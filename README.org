* What is this

I am playing with technology and trying new things. Because JIRA does not provide
such functionality out of the box, I would like to develop SPA to play it with my
team. I am aware about tons of /similar/ products existing in this area (all are paid!), 
never seen any of them, and actually the work I do here is mostly for _my personal skills 
development_.

* Architecture & UI ideas [6/6]

 - [X] FastAPI on Backend
 - [X] UIX^2 on Frontend
 - [X] .env configuration
 - [X] Local memory caching for retrieved Jira data
 - [X] Websocket for group actions
 - [X] Logging screen on frontend (from websocket log)
   - [X] "Vote accepted from ..."
   - [X] "User ... logged in"

* Install
  Backend:
  #+begin_src tmux
  poetry install
  #+end_src
* Setup

  Copy & edit contents of .env file: setup variables

#+begin_example
cp .env-example .env
#+end_example
  
  To do this you will need to create Google Project and obtain Oauth authorization keys.

- [2024-09-14 Sat 15:35] got tired by implementing websocket coordination but it finally works
- [ ] auto reconnect web socket?!!
- [X] send current screen info after auto reconnect/connect!
- [X] +'sync' button to reconnect websocket (red/green/auto reconnect)+ can use Home!
- [X] Synhronize current screen
  - add 'app-state' endpoint - we will check this after login/on app load because
    async user can do anything async
  - react to ws messages online - e.g. commands:
    - +[ ] Goto screen <name>+
    - [X] Vote for ticket <jira id>
    - [X] Voting finished (works for manual finish too)
    - [X] User logged in: (<username>)
    - [X] Online members (16): A, B, C
- [X] Display voting results when 'voting finished' received
- [X] Listen & display online members (log)
- [X] websocket for logging updates!
