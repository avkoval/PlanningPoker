* What is this

I am playing with technology and trying new things. Because JIRA does not provide
such functionality out of the box, I would like to develop SPA to play it with my
team. I am aware about tons of similar products existing in this area, never seen
any of them, and actually the work I do here is mostly for my personal skills 
development.
